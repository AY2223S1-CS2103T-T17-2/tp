### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Food` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `NutriGoalsParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a food).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `NutriGoalsParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `NutriGoalsParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the nutrigoals data i.e., all `Food` objects (which are contained in a `FoodList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Food` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both nutrigoals data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `NutriGoalsStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.nutrigoals.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Set Daily Calorie Target feature

#### Implementation

The set target mechanism is facilitated by `TargetCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following
operation:

* `TargetCommand#excecute()`: Sets the calorie target for the day

Given below is an example usage scenario and how set calorie target mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application today.

Step 2. The user executes `target 2103`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. 
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called subsequently, which then creates a `TargetCommandParser` object.
`TargetCommandParser#parser()` is then called to make sense of the arguments supplied by the user.

Step 3. The `TargetCommand` is created, and then executed by `TargetCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. The `TargetCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:
* `setCalorieTarget(calorieTarget)`
* `getCalorieTarget()`

Step 5. `TargetCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following result displayed:

Your calorie target set for today: 2103 calories

The following diagram illustrates how the set calorie target operation works:

![TargetSequenceDiagram](./images/TargetSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `EditCommand#execute()`: Edits the food name, meal type or calories associated with the food at the specified index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. Suppose the foods added for the day are:

1. bread: 100 calories, breakfast
2. milk tea: 300 calories, lunch
3. sushi: 500 calories, lunch

Step 2. The user executes `edit 2 n/honey milk tea c/310`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called subsequently, which then creates an `EditCommandParser` object.
`EditCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the arguments supplied by the user.

Step 3. The `EditCommand` is created, and then executed by `EditCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `EditCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#setFood(foodToEdit, editedFood)` replaces `foodToEdit` to `editedFood`.
* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(predicate)` filters the food list based on the given predicate

Step 5. `EditCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following result displayed:

Edited Food: honey milk tea; Calories: 310 calories; Tag[lunch]

The following diagram illustrates how the edit operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](./images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Setup feature

#### Implementation

The setup mechanism is facilitated by `SetupCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following 
operation: 

* `SetupCommand#execute()`: Sets up the user profile.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the setup mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `setup h/170 w/65 i/60 g/m a/20`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. `NutriGoals#parseCommand()` 
is called subsequently, which then creates an `SetupCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SetupCommand` created is executed by `SetupCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `SetupCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#setUserDetails()`
* `Model#getUserDetails()`

Step 5. `SetupCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` which displays the user's information.

The following diagram illustrates how the setup operation works.
![SetupSequenceDiagram](./images/SetupSequenceDiagram.png)

### Profile feature

#### Implementation

The profile mechanism is facilitated by `ProfileCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the
following operation:

* `ProfileCommand#execute()`: Retrieves and displays the user's information.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the profile mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022.

Step 2. The user executes `profile`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. `NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called
subsequently, which then creates an `ProfileCommand` object.

Step 3. The `ProfileCommand` created is executed by `ProfileCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `ProfileCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#isUserCreated()`
* `Model#getUserDetails()`

Step 5. `ProfileCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` which displays the user's information.

The following activity diagram outlines the process when the user executes the `ProfileCommand`.

![ProfileCommandActivityDiagram](./images/ProfileCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### List feature

#### Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `ListCommand#execute()`: Shows a list of all food items and their respective calories for the specified day (if any).

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. `NutriGoals` initially displays all foods added on the 
current day, 19 October 2022.

Step 2. The user executes `list 2022-07-29` command, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called subsequently, which then creates a `ListCommandParser` object.
`ListCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the date argument supplied by the user.

Step 3. A `ListCommand` object is created with an `IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate` object. The predicate is initialised with 29 July 2022 as the date.

The following object diagram illustrates this.

![ListObjectDiagram](./images/ListObjectDiagram.png)

Step 4. `ListCommand` is then executed by `ListCommand#execute()`, which calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate)` filters the food list for foods added on 29 July 2022
* `Model#isFilteredFoodListEmpty()`

Step 5. The filtered food list is shown to the user and `ListCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with a message 
indicating the successful execution of the `list` command. 

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `list` command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

### Review feature

#### Implementation

The review mechanism is facilitated by `ReviewCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `ReviewCommand#execute()`: Calculates the total calories, the calorie target and the deficient or excess amount of
  calories for the day.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. Suppose the foods added for the day are:

1. bubble tea: 232 kcal
2. chicken rice: 702 kcal
3. wanton noodles: 409 kcal

Step 2. The user executes `review` command, which creates a `ReviewCommand` object. 

Step 3. The `ReviewCommand` created is executed by `ReviewCommand#execute()`. 

Step 4. `ReviewCommand#execute()` creates an `IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate` object with 19 October 2022 as the date.

Step 5. `ReviewCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate)` filters the food list for foods added on 19 October 2022
* `Model#getTotalCalorie()`
* `Model#getCalorieTarget()`
* `Model#getCalorieDifference()`

Step 6. `ReviewCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following information to be displayed to the user:

* total calories: 1343 kcal
* calorie target: 2000 kcal
* deficient amount of calories: 657 kcal

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the review operation works:

![ReviewSequenceDiagram](images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png)

### Suggest feature

#### Implementation

The suggest mechanism is facilitated by `SuggestCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `SuggestCommand#execute()`: Calculates a suggested amount of calories a user should consume per day.

The following illustrates what objects are created when `suggest` is executed.

![SuggestObjectDiagram](images/SuggestObjectDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application today.

Step 2. The user executes `suggest` command, which creates a `SuggestCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SuggestCommand` created is executed by `SuggestCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `SuggestCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#isUserCreated()`
* `Model#calculateSuggestedCalorie()`

Step 5. `SuggestCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` that displays an estimated suggested amount of calories the user should consume per day.

The following activity diagram outlines what happens when a user executes the `suggest` command:

![SuggestActivityDiagram](images/SuggestActivityDiagram.png)

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operations

* `FindCommand#execute()`: Looks through all previously consumed food items and searches for those whose name matches the predicate. Returns the average calorie content for that particular food item if it is inside the list. If it is not in the list, checks if the food item is in the default list provided, and returns the suggested calorie content from the default list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `find Banana` command, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called subsequently, which then creates a `FindCommandParser` object.
`FindCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the food name supplied by the user.

Step 3. A `FindCommand` object is created and then executed by `FindCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. The `FindCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`

* `Model#getFoodCalorieList()`
* `Model#getUnfilteredFoodList()`

Step 5. The `FindCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` that displays the calorie content of the food item specified by the user which in this case is Banana.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### Locate gym feature

#### Implementation

The locate gym mechanism is facilitated by `LocateGymCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the
following operation:

* `LocateGymCommand#execute()`: Returns a list of gyms sorted by distance.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the locate-gym mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `locate CLB`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. `NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is called
subsequently, which then creates an `LocateGymCommand` object.

Step 3. The `LocateGymCommand` created is executed by `LocateGymCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `LocateGymCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#getNusGymLocations()`

The following activity diagram outlines what happens when a user executes the `locate` command:
