### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app targeted at NUS students who wish to improve their current lifestyle and want to adopt
a healthier lifestyle by tracking the user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of keeping
track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the various
fitness goals that you have set for yourself! However, without the right tools, tracking what you have consumed can be
tedious and at times disorganised. With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily, without
worrying about organising your data.
