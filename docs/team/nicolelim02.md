### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app that tracks a user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of keeping track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the various fitness goals that you have set for yourself! However, without the right tools, tracking what you have consumed can be tedious and at times disorganised. With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily, without worrying about organising your data.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for the user to view his/her profile.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view the profile created.
  * Justification: Every application that allows the user to set up a profile should allow the user to view the information he/she keyed in previously.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to check if the current information stored is correct.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to calculate the user's BMI.
  * What it does: Calculates the user's BMI immediately after setting up a profile.
  * Justification: This application aims to encourage healthy eating habits. The BMI is a useful (although imperfect) indicator of the user's health status.
  * Highlights: This enhancement automatically calculates the user's BMI when the user creates a profile or updates existing information.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to suggest a recommended calorie intake for the user.
  * What it does: Suggests an estimated recommended daily calorie intake so that the user can reach his/her ideal weight.
  * Justification: The application allows the user to set a target calorie intake, but the user may not be aware of the amount of calories he / she should be consuming to reach his/her ideal weight. This feature can provide the user with an estimated amount of calorie he / she should consume.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows the user the get a rough estimate of the amount of calories he / she should consume in a day. This command complements the `target` command.
