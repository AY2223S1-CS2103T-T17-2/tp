### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app that tracks a user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of
keeping track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the
various fitness goals that you have set for yourself!
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: TargetCommand (PR [#35](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/35))
    * What it does: It allows the user to set a daily calorie goal.
    * Justification: The project aims to help users to keep track of their calorie intake. Setting a target daily
      calorie allows a user to keep track of the amount of calories left to consume within their target.

* **New Feature**: LocateGymCommand (PR [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/66))
    * What it does: Returns a list of gyms in NUS sorted by distance to the user
    * Justification: The project aims to help users start a healthy lifestyle. But after having online lessons for
      several years, some students are not familiar with NUS' facilities. This command helps the users to find gyms with
      ease.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Styled UI of app to match the theme and increase appeal.
