### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app that tracks a user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of keeping track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the various fitness goals that you have set for yourself! However, without the right tools, tracking what you have consumed can be tedious and at times disorganised. With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily, without worrying about organising your data.
